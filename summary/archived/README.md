# Archived Documentation

This directory contains the original summary documents that have been consolidated into the structured CLAUDE.md documentation hierarchy.

## Consolidation

The content from these documents has been integrated into:

### From 1-VideoContext_and_open_sidepanel.md:
- **[src/hooks/videoContext/CLAUDE.md](../../src/hooks/videoContext/CLAUDE.md)** - Video context extraction and caching
- **[src/background/CLAUDE.md](../../src/background/CLAUDE.md)** - Tab lifecycle and message handlers
- **[src/utils/yt_extraction/CLAUDE.md](../../src/utils/yt_extraction/CLAUDE.md)** - YouTube transcript and chapter extraction

### From 2-SidepanelFlow_and_ChatSession.md:
- **[src/hooks/chat/CLAUDE.md](../../src/hooks/chat/CLAUDE.md)** - Chat orchestration, AI session, streaming
- **[src/stores/CLAUDE.md](../../src/stores/CLAUDE.md)** - Zustand state management
- **[src/components/chat/CLAUDE.md](../../src/components/chat/CLAUDE.md)** - UI component hierarchy
- **[src/background/CLAUDE.md](../../src/background/CLAUDE.md)** - Sidepanel lifecycle management

### Main Documentation Entry Point:
- **[CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md)** - High-level overview with references to detailed docs

## Why Archive?

These documents provided excellent comprehensive overviews but were:
1. Not co-located with the code they documented
2. Too lengthy for quick reference
3. Not discoverable by directory browsing

The new structure:
- Places documentation alongside relevant code
- Provides focused, actionable guidance for each directory
- Maintains high-level overview in main CLAUDE.md
- Improves navigation and discoverability

## Accessing Original Content

These archived documents remain available for reference and contain valuable sequence diagrams and detailed explanations that may not be fully captured in the directory-specific docs.
